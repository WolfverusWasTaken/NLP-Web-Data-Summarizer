# Project DOLOS [Scrapped]
I will be focusing on developing this project with LLMs.

---
DOLOS is a NLP Extractive Webpage summarizer. It is made with the Parrot Framework. This project will be improved on and new features will be implemented.

## To Do
- A search engine that gets data from various sources like Google Scholar.
- A frontend component preferably a windows desktop app.
- Faster execution of algorithm and better performance.

## Dependencies

```python
import nltk
import pickle
import transformers
import pandas

```


## About/Preview
DOLOS can extract data from a website and extract the relevant parts of the webpage using a Word Score. After which, using the [Parrot Framework](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/Parrot_Paraphraser), the extracted data will then be summarized. After which, the sentence will then undergo truecasing which will properly identify and change the capitalization of the words.
